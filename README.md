## Challenege

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (that was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

### Acceptance criteria

By the end of the week (Boris Bikes Challenge) I should be able too:
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### My Code Goals:
* I can TDD anything
By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.
* I can program fluently
You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.
* I can debug anything
You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.
